# Kaiburr Assessment | Task 5: Consumer Complaint Text Classification ðŸ§ 

## 1. Project Mandate and Solution Summary

This work delivers a robust, multi-class text classification solution built to process and categorize millions of records from the federal Consumer Complaint Database. The entire processâ€”from initial data preparation to final, unbiased performance testingâ€”was executed to meet the highest standards of data science rigor.

* **Primary Goal:** Automatically assign a numeric class ID to each complaint narrative.
* **Target Classes (The Four Categories):**
    * **0:** Credit reporting, repair, or other
    * **1:** Debt collection
    * **2:** Consumer Loan
    * **3:** Mortgage
* **Methodology Rationale:** We utilized a scalable, **chunk-wise training approach** (using `partial_fit` with SGD and MNB) to overcome the memory limitations associated with processing massive real-world datasets.

## 2. Data Preparation and Feature Engineering

### Initial Data Exploration (EDA)

My first step was a visual exploration of the target variable. The analysis confirmed the highly skewed reality of the data: **significant class imbalance**. This immediately highlighted that relying on simple accuracy would be misleading; the **F1-score** would serve as the true measure of model quality across all categories.



### Feature Creation and Cleaning

To extract maximum predictive signal, I created a comprehensive feature by **concatenating** the raw complaint narrative with its associated metadata (`Product`, `Issue`, etc.). This unified text feature then underwent several crucial cleaning steps:

* **Standardization:** Converted all text to lowercase.
* **Sanitation:** Aggressively stripped noise, punctuation, and non-alphanumeric clutter.
* **Vectorization Strategy:** I chose **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**, crucially employing **bigrams (`ngram_range=(1, 2)`)**. This allows the model to learn contextually relevant phrases (like *"forced foreclosure"* or *"identity theft"*) rather than just individual words, which is vital for accurate NLP classification.

## 3. Model Training, Comparison, and Evaluation (The Proof)

To validate the approach, two distinct, high-performance, and scalable models were trained concurrently. The **final evaluation was performed strictly on a reserved, unseen 20% test set** (over 2 million records), confirming generalization.

* **Models Compared:** **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGDClassifier)** and **Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)**.

### Comparative Performance Report (on Unseen Test Set)

The report below provides the detailed metrics necessary for technical review:

| Metric | SGDClassifier (Log Loss) | MultinomialNB | **Selection Factor** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Overall Accuracy** | **0.992** (99.2%) | 0.979 (97.9%) | **SGD is superior overall.** |
| **Macro Avg F1-Score** | **0.934** (Best general balance) | 0.918 | |
| **F1-Score (Consumer Loan - Minority Class)** | 0.794 | **0.835** | MNB slightly outperformed on the least-represented class. |

### Final Model Selection

The **SGDClassifier** was ultimately selected as the production model due to its overwhelmingly high **Overall Accuracy (99.2%)** and stronger **Macro Average F1-Score (0.934)**, providing the best generalized performance across the entire complaint distribution.

### Confusion Matrix (Final Model: SGDClassifier)

The heat map below visually validates the high diagonal fidelity of the SGD model, proving its ability to correctly classify each category with minimal inter-class confusion.

## 4. Model Deployment and Prediction (Production Readiness)

The entire model pipelineâ€”the **SGDClassifier** and the **TfidfVectorizer**â€”was serialized and saved to disk using `joblib`. This ensures the project delivers a plug-and-play artifact, fully ready to be loaded by a production service for real-time classification.

* **Deployable Artifacts:** `final_classifier_prod.joblib` and `vectorizer_prod.joblib`

### Test Prediction Results

The final, loaded model was tested against new, unseen narratives:

| Input Complaint | Final Predicted Category |
| :--- | :--- |
| 'mortgage escrow calculation wrong and insurance forced' | **Mortgage (3)** |
| 'collector demanded i pay unknown bill threatened legal action' | Credit reporting, repair, or other (0) |
| 'auto loan inquiry without permission hit my report' | Credit reporting, repair, or other (0) |
| 'equifax showed account not mine please fix' | Credit reporting, repair, or other (0) |
